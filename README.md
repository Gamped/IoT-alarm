# IoT Alarm: 5the semester project
The number of IoT devices is greatly increasing day by day. The paper examined how this technology can be combined with cheap and open-source hardware, such as an Arduino, to create a potable motion-sensor, which can work as a part of a greater physical security system. A device living up to these criteria has been designed and developed throughout the process of writing this project. 
## Features:
- Ensure pull data from sensors fast enough to detect people *(Real-time scheduling)*
- Ability to detect infrared spectrum changes with the PIR sensor
- Ability to measure light-intensity with LDR and distance to a point with ultrasonic sensor
- Ability to determine irregular readings from ultrasonic and LDR, while allowing for a naturally changing environment
- Networking is designed to live up to Sigfox network requirements
## Hardware
The following hardware is used in the solution:
- **Mainboard:** Arduino UNO R3
- **PIR Sensor:** HC-SR501
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** HC-SR04
- **LDR:** *No model-number*
- **RFID Reader:** RFID-RC522
- **LED:** *No model-number*
